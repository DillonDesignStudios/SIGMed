                SIG Medical Closes Seed Round for Rib Fracture Repair
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="articleText">
            <p>
                HERSHEY, PA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With rib fractures impacting 40% of patients admitted to major trauma centers, 350,000 patients in the US alone, SIG Medical is poised to become one of the fastest growing medical device companies. SIG Medical’s innovative product, AdvantageRib, is an intrathoracic procedure to treat rib fractures through a minimally invasive approach. Utilizing small stab incisions, AdvantageRib is a revolutionary treatment algorithm as compared to current methods which include large open incisions or continuous doses of opioid pain medications.<br><br>
                
                SIG Medical closed its Series Seed Funding round comprised of private investors including Ian Bund of Plymouth Growth Partners and venture capital groups including Ben Franklin Technology Partners. The company will utilize the investment to accelerate the commercialization of its already FDA approved products and to continue to develop innovative thoracic medical devices.<br><br>
                
                “We are excited to have the support of world-class investors who recognize the opportunity to improve healthcare,” said Ken Kremer, President and CEO of SIG Medical. “With AdvantageRib, surgeons finally have what they have been asking for; an effective and less invasive way of treating rib fractures. Payors now have a solution that reduces healthcare spending. And most importantly, patients now have access to a procedure that radically improves their care. This investment will allow us to continue to innovate and accelerate our mission of bringing revolutionary treatment to hundreds of thousands of suffering patients.”<br><br>
                
                The AdvantageRib technology was developed at Penn State College of Medicine, Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. It was there initial clinical cases were performed; with the first patient over a year out from a successful surgery and recovery. In the fourth quarter of 2018, SIG Medical began to expand its reach outside of Hershey Medical Center. Dr. Christopher Towe MD, Clinical Assistant Professor of Surgery at CWRU School of Medicine in Cleveland recently presented his experience utilizing AdvantageRib at Harvard’s Innovations in Chest Wall Surgery Course. “AdvantageRib is very clever, there is an advantage to incision size and I have had success with AdvantageRib,” said Dr. Towe at Harvard. “The days of a patient presenting with a rib fracture and then being off work for 70 days doesn’t work anymore. As a doctor, you can’t have a patient with a rib fracture and hand them a script for 250 oxycodone and say Ill see you in 4 weeks, those strategies are gone. SIG Medical has developed a novel system to help patients with rib fractures that can be truly minimally invasive.”<br><br>
